  ## Description

  This team profile generator automatically generates a visual "My Team" HTML file for your team based on short, quick, and simple user prompts. Using a command-line interface, you will be asked a series of quick and easy questions about the team members you wish to include. This app then saves your answers and automatically generates a professional, visual "My Team" file for your project including information about your team members, including whether they are engineers or interns and appropriate information for each.
